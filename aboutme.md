My name is Colm Duffy and I am an environmental systems modeller. I am motivated by environmental and social justice.

## A little history
I went to university as a mature student studying International Development and that gave me the opportunity to work in many different contexts such as Malawi and Kenya with the World AgroForestry Centre ([ICRAF](https://www.worldagroforestry.org/)) and Zambia with [Camara Education](https://camara.org/). These experiences, and many more, were wonderful opportunities to broaden my view of the world and have been key to shaping the person and researcher I am today.

I hold BSc in International development and food policy and an MSc in Climate change, agriculture and food security. In 2019, I finished my PhD in Climate Smart Agriculture. It was toward the end of my PhD that I really found my focus. I began looking at land-use and land-use change in and Irish context. I have since gone on develop several land use models, including the [GOBLIN model land-use model](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2239/2022/).

Modelling systems has led me to incrementally build an array of skills that allow for increasingly complex model development. As time has gone on, I have gained qualifications and experience in software engineering, consequential and attributional lifecycle analysis, spatial mapping and econometrics.

Why do I enjoy modelling systems? Because, imagining a more sustainable world, and building it's virtual components and using them to assist decision-makers in the real world is incredibly rewarding.
