Hi!,
My name is Colm Duffy, and I am highly motivated by environmental and social justice. I went to university as a mature student, and that gave me the opportunity to work in many different contexts such as Malawi with the World AgroForestry Centre ([ICRAF](https://www.worldagroforestry.org/))

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
